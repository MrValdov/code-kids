# code-kids
Coding course for kids.

This project idea was born from the need to teach my own kids about the logics and how to convert that into coding.

Code-Kids mission is to teach everyone who is interested in learning how to code, offering an interactive interface and a very basic language to help understand all concepts and the different elements asociated with logics, data, processes and finally coding. The syllabus is inspired in the 2003 educational program of the Information Technologies course tought by Technical Colleges aroud the Globe. Code-Kids offers an evolving educational program as it presents material to learn the latest programming languages and it will constantly be updated to add any upcoming technology related to coding. 

Under the light of recent advances we need to make it clear that Code-Kids does not look into offer any trainig in the use of AI technologies.
